# **NLP priject**


**Natural Language Processing (NLP)** models are statistical models that analyze human language patterns and predict the likelihood of a sequence of words occurring in a sentence. They are a core component of NLP and are used in many applications, including:
Predictive text input systems, Speech recognition, Machine translation, Spelling correction, Autocomplete, Autocorrect, Transcription, and Social media. 
Language models are trained using a set of example sentences, and their output is a probability distribution over word sequences. 
Other NLP techniques include:
Sentiment analysis
Determines if data is positive, negative, or neutral. This technique is often used by businesses to analyze customer feedback and understand their needs.
Named entity recognition (NER)
Identifies and classifies named entities in text, such as people, organizations, locations, and dates.

A transformer model is a neural network that uses deep learning architecture to process sequential data and learn context and meaning. It was developed by Google and is based on the multi-head attention mechanism, which was proposed in a 2017 paper titled "Attention Is All You Need". 
Transformer models work by passing input data through layers that contain self-attention mechanisms and feedforward neural networks. The models analyze the relationships between different elements to understand context and meaning, and they rely on a mathematical technique called attention to do so. For example, in natural language processing (NLP), transformer models can use positional encoding to add information about the relative or absolute position of words in a sentence. This allows the model to consider word position when processing the sentence. 
Transformer models are well suited for applications that involve modeling long chains of data, such as amino acids that fold into protein structures. This can be useful for drug discovery and understanding biological processes, and for predicting the 3D structure of proteins based on their amino acid sequences.

Transformer models are neural networks that process input data in parallel using a self-attention mechanism and feedforward neural networks. This allows the model to consider different parts of the input sequence at once, rather than sequentially, and determine which parts are most important. This parallel processing makes transformer models faster and more efficient than traditional recurrent neural networks (RNNs), making them well-suited for processing large datasets. 
Transformer models are often used for sequence transduction or neural machine translation, such as translating a sentence from one language to another. For example, to translate the sentence "I love you" from English to Spanish, a transformer model would first encode the sentence into a sequence of vectors, and then decode the vectors into a sequence of Spanish words. The self-attention mechanism would allow the model to focus on the words "I" and "you" in the English sentence when decoding the Spanish words "te amo".
